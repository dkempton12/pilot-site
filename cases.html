				<h4>Whitney on Main, Watertown, MA</h4>
				<p>A 1970’s 280-unit apartment complex, these six mid-rise buildings located on Route 20 (Main Street) in Watertown Square, were sold to Pilot as part of the original developer's estate planning strategy. Significant deferred maintenance throughout the property and below market rents provided an excellent added-value opportunity.</p>
				<p>Units, including kitchens and baths, were remodeled; elevators upgraded; common hallways and stairwells updated; a new fitness center and management office were added; underground parking garage structurally rehabilitated; balconies were painted and screened for privacy; parking lots resurfaced; landscaping replaced; and a third party professional residential management team was brought onsite.</p>

				<h4>Sagamore Towers, Quincy, MA</h4>
				<p>An aged 12-story, 225-unit 1970’s high rise apartment complex was in need of major interior and exterior renovations to compete with numerous nearby apartment options that had come on-line recently. We were hired as an advisor to the long time owner to determine how best to position the property for sale and to assist with the search for a buyer.</p>
				<p>One complication with the sale option was the fact that the current loan on the property included a $3.5 million prepayment penalty. It was determined that the penalty could be overcome if a strong buyer was willing and able to acquire the property through a beneficial interest in the seller’s trust. Charles E. Smith Residential Realty from Washington, D.C. (now part of Archstone Communities) was introduced to the property, purchased the asset, and promptly proceeded with a full scale redevelop program.</p>
